Approver Interview Guide

Purpose: Capture approval criteria, thresholds, exception handling, SLAs, and evidence requirements.

Questions:
1. Which types of PR/PO require your approval?
2. What thresholds do you rely on to approve or escalate a request?
3. What documentation do you expect to see before approving?
4. Do you use delegated authority — if so, how is it recorded?
5. How do you handle escalations or requests for retrospective approvals?
6. What turnaround time (SLA) do you follow for approvals of different bands?
7. What common evidence do you check (comparative statements, vendor background, technical specs)?
8. When do you call for Legal/Compliance involvement?
9. What constitutes an exception that must go to MD or CVC committee?
10. How do you prefer to receive approval tasks (email, dashboard, mobile)?
11. Which manual checks would you be comfortable automating?
12. Describe a recent approval that required significant investigation — why?

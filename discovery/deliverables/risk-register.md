# Discovery Phase Risk Register

Top risks and mitigations

1. Risk: Delayed SAP data extracts — Mitigation: IT to provide sample extracts within 5 business days; request anonymized CSVs
2. Risk: Legal disagrees on rule interpretations — Mitigation: Schedule early legal review sessions and lock semantics in writing
3. Risk: Stakeholder unavailability — Mitigation: Reserve recurring 60-min weekly windows and record sessions
4. Risk: Vendor master inaccuracies — Mitigation: Include vendor data quality checks and reconcile top 100 vendors
5. Risk: Scope creep— Mitigation: Freeze core discovery scope; treat extras as separate change requests
6. Risk: Security constraints for sandbox access — Mitigation: Use anonymized data and run analysis in IT-approved environment
7. Risk: Incomplete approvals matrix — Mitigation: Validate with actual approval logs and sample escalations
8. Risk: Misalignment on thresholds — Mitigation: Map thresholds to policy documents and get formal sign-off

Each risk should have an owner and a target mitigation date; update register weekly.

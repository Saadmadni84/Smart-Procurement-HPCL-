# Frontend — HPCL Procurement Automation (React + Vite)

This folder contains a lightweight starter for the React + Vite frontend for the Procurement Automation dashboard.

Structure
- `index.html` — app container
- `src/` — React application source
- `src/components` — reusable UI components
- `src/pages` — page-level components (Dashboard, Approvals, Rules)
- `styles/hpcl-theme.css` — HPCL-inspired theme

Next steps
- Run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to start local dev server
- Implement core pages: Approvals list, PR detail, Rule editor
- Integrate with backend APIs (create API client and auth middleware)

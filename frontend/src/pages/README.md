# Pages

This folder will contain page-level components (routes):

- `Dashboard.jsx` — main overview with KPIs and quick actions
- `PurchaseRequests.jsx` — list and create PRs
- `Approvals.jsx` — pending approvals inbox
- `Rules.jsx` — rules catalog management
- `Reports.jsx` — analytics and audit reports
- `Admin.jsx` — user management and settings

Each page should import layout components and connect to backend APIs.

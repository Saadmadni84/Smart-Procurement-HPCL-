# Components

This folder will contain reusable React components:

- `Header.jsx` — top navigation bar (HPCL-themed)
- `Sidebar.jsx` — left navigation drawer
- `Card.jsx` — card wrapper for info panels
- `Button.jsx` — custom button with HPCL styles
- `Table.jsx` — data table for PRs, approvals, and rules
- `Modal.jsx` — modal dialogs for forms

In Step 2, implement these components as you build out pages.
